# TikTok Clone  

This project was created to model the design features of the TikTok application. The main goal was to focus on the design and user interface aspects, practicing with SwiftUI to build a visually appealing interface. The user and video data were randomly generated, and free videos from Pexels were used. The project is intended for educational and personal development purposes.   More advanced and future-oriented design patterns could have been used, but the goal of this project was to create a TikTok clone with a beautiful UI in a short amount of time.
